# qch_vm
Implements a Chip-8 virtual machine as described on the [wiki][] page.

Contains master `spec.hpp` file that defines `qch_asm` assembly.

# TODO
- explore alternative implementations ([cowgod's ref][], SCHIP, CHIP-48, etc.)
- add switches to change between different versions?
- add debugging options (breakpoints, single step, etc.)
